## How to Publish on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new public repository (e.g., `jahzjet-school-website`).

2. **Upload your files**
   - Upload all files from the `edumax-website` folder (including `index.html`, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to your new repository.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository's Settings > Pages.
   - Under "Source", select the branch (usually `main`) and `/root` (if asked for folder).
   - Save. GitHub will provide a link to your live site (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/jahzjet-school-website/`).
